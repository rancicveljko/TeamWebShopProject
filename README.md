# TeamWebShopProject
This is an academic team project whose goal was to port a legacy web app made with jQuery into a more evergreen, future-proof technology that is vanilla JavaScript and .NET. 
Working on the project cultivated our development of team cohesion and optimal labor divison, along with practice of web development.
The web app contains the basic functionalities of a Web Shop, like adding items to a cart and checking out. It also contains web shop management functionalities like managing items in the shop and managing customer's user account.
